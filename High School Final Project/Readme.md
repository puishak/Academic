# High School Final Project
This was the final project me and my teammates were working on as the final project of our grade 12 computer science class(ICS4U).
The purpose of the project was to create a software where you and other people using the same computer can play a few games and
track the progress and high score of each game.
This is only part of the project that I worked on
I was in charge of creating the UI.
I implemented a single player system and a multiplayer system. In the single player system the user is able to create an account,
login to an existing account or, play as a guest. There is a simple username and password check implemented, no extensive security 
is implemented. The user is able to change the user name, password, first name, last name, and the avatar by clicking the avatar
from the top right corner. User is also able to logout and start from the beginning. The user info and highscores from the games
are stored in a .txt file.
